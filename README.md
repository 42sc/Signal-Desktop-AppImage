# Signal-Desktop-AppImage

This is a bash script for building Signal Desktop Client from source. It produces Signal-5.6.2.AppImage , an [AppImage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage) file which can possibly run on different Linux distributions, including Fedora.

[Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is an encrypted messaging service developed by the Signal Technology Foundation and Signal Messenger LLC. 
While they distribute binaries for WIndows, MacOS and Android, unfortunately they only seem to officially support Debian based Linux distros.  

The script was tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 21.04. The AppImage it produced successfully ran on Fedora.
